# SO-A-CodeGenerator

In this project I'm trying to expand code generation feature of Unity-Atoms.
I use Roslyn to analyze interfaces and generate scriptable object class and scriptable object variables assets
to reduce some boilerplate codes for serialization and deserialization systems when using scriptable object architecture in online projects.
